# UtilGenerator

This - very small - library can generate boilerplate code in a C# WPF MVVM application.
All of this is highly inspired by the original CommunityToolkit MVVM and has nowhere near as many functionality as said library.

Disclaimer: I strongly advice against using this library in production code since it was only developed for educational purposes.
