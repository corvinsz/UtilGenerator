# UtilGenerator

This - very small - library can generate boilerplate code in a C# WPF MVVM application.
All of this is highly inspired by the original <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/communitytoolkit/mvvm/">CommunityToolkit MVVM</a> and has nowhere near as much functionality as said library.

Disclaimer: I strongly advice against using this library in production code since it was only developed for educational purposes.
